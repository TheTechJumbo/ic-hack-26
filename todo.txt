The frontend needs to be improved, significantly.

1. I want a user to submit what they're recovering from, and receive a personalised voice note accordingly.

2. It needs to be deployed to vercel (it's currently hosted on github) - give me instructions on how to do this.

3. I would like for the telegram bot to be able to make phone calls. This can then start a conversation between an elevenlabs voice agent and the user, so that the agent can provide instant support.

4. I want a user to be able to submit the voice of a loved one, friend, or even themselves. There's evidence that interaction with friends, a loved one, or someone's "future self" can improve rehab outcomes. So if we're able to create an elevenlabs voice clone in the frontend from an audio sample that then acts as the voice note, that would be helpful.

5. The agent should break character immediately and send a text message with emergency numbers or a helpline if the user displays suicidal or very harmful tendencies.
